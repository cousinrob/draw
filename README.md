An in-browser drawing pad project.
When completed this project will demonstrate skills in Javascript, CSS and HTML.
I will create a grid that will change colors with mouse movement. There will be different "pen sizes" available by changing the size of the grid, different pen colors, an eraser and a "clear" button.
